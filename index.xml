      <description>Description Volu-Firm® Advanced Lifting Serum concentrates its action by reclaiming your triangle of youth. This triangle – full cheeks, a defined jawline, a taut neck – embodies youthfulness. But as skin ages, this area can become compromised. The cheeks can appear hollow. The jawline can start to sag. And crepiness can begin to show on the neck. Your best defense is Volu-Firm® Advanced Lifting Serum.
